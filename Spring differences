Feature                | Spring                              | Spring Boot                          
---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------
Framework Type        | Core framework for Java apps     | Extension of Spring for rapid dev   
Configuration         | Manual XML/Java-based setup      | Auto-configuration using Starters   
Boilerplate Code      | Requires more setup              | Reduces boilerplate code            
Dependency Management | Manual dependency handling       | Uses Spring Boot Starters           
Embedded Server      | Requires external server setup   | Comes with Tomcat, Jetty, etc.      
Microservices Support| Needs additional setup           | Designed for microservices         
Production Ready     | Needs external monitoring tools  | Includes Actuator for monitoring    

| Feature                     | Spring                                        | Spring Boot                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Configuration                | Requires manual configuration (XML or Java)  | Auto-configures most settings based on dependencies |
| Project Setup                | Can be complex, requires setup of multiple files (e.g., applicationContext.xml) | Provides a simple way to set up applications with default configurations |
| Dependencies                 | Requires manual management of dependencies   | Uses "Spring Boot Starter" dependencies to simplify dependency management |
| Standalone                   | Often requires an external server (e.g., Tomcat) | Comes with an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) |
| Development Speed            | Slower due to manual setup and configuration | Faster development with pre-configured templates and defaults |
| Configuration Files          | Relies on XML or Java-based configuration files | Primarily uses application.properties or application.yml |
| Embedded Server              | No built-in embedded server                  | Provides embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow for running the application |
| Complexity                   | More complex and requires more boilerplate   | Simplifies code and reduces complexity through auto-configuration and conventions |
Production Ready     | Needs external monitoring tools  | Includes Actuator for monitoring
